        blurb: `
            <p>In ADHD Vol. 2 Instead of simply compiling a collection of his well produced beats, Dstroy takes you on a stunning journey of almost 60 beats played over 10 different tracks each averaging 5 minutes in length and consisting of at least 4 different beats. With all the beats blended together with in an almost DJ like fashion with seamless transitions, occasionally bizarre yet perfect vocal sample usage and a prevalent dedication to consistent quality. Dstroy's sequel sends you deep into the hyperactive, ever changing ADHD world hes crafted and and takes the listener through a wide range of styles and genres from chilled out moments, to head banging percussive boom bap beats and hyped danceable segments ADHD vol 2 gives Leonard the remote control. thankfully we can always rewind.

        blurb: `
            MelodySoul is extremely proud to present an exceptionally talented production duo based out of Kansas City, MO.
